Statistical Analysis of the Relationship Between Height and High Scores in a Bowling League  
  
A math professor intuits that there is a positive correlation between the height  
of bowlers in his bowling league and their high scores, i.e. he believes that  
taller bowlers tend to have higher scores. He wants to test the hypothesis  
because he has noticed that tallest bowlers in the league typically do not  
bowl the highest scores.  
  
At a league event, the professor notes the height and the high score of each  
participant and calculates the correlation and covariance between these  
two metrics.  
  
Correlation is scaled on a range from -1 to 1. A positive correlation  
will confirm the professor's intuition that taller bowlers have higher scores.  
  
A negative correlation will confirm the opposite, i.e. that the professor  
is wrong, and taller bowlers actually have lower scores.  
  
A correlation near zero would indicate that there is no correlation between  
height and bowling score.  
  
Is the professor correct?
